"""Lifeforms represent the evolving patterns whenever a rule is applied. In
Seagull, lifeforms are first-class citizens: you can add them to the board,
view them independently, compose, customize, and the like. This library
provides a collection of pre-made lifeforms that you can play around.

Lifeforms are arranged into categories based on their configurations (excluding the Base and Custom lifeforms):

    seagull.lifeforms.growers
    seagull.lifeforms.oscillators
